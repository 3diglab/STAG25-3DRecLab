# STAG 25 - 3D Reconstruction Lab

This repo contains a notebook (to run on Colab) and the required data/model assets.

Upload the notebook to your Drive, open with Colab, and upload the zip file to the `content/` folder once you're connected to a runtime.

**WARNING**: you need a GPU runtime to run the experiments in the notebook, as `kaolin` only supports CUDA backends for differentiable rendering.
